## 📘 Overview  
This project investigates the relationship between weather conditions such as **precipitation, temperature, and wind** and flight delays.  
By combining flight and weather datasets, we use SQL and Python-based analytics to clean, merge, and visualize data, uncovering key patterns that contribute to delays in air travel.
